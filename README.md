This project was created as a graduation subject for an IT subject at grammar school (Gymnázium Ústí nad Orlicí).

## Caution
This was a first bigger project that I've ever developed. I did not have a lot of skill, yet I managed to stick the code together and it worked. The code has many flaws and should be refractored.

## About
2 Second Dungeon is a 2D dungeon crawler with a twist! Enter the dungeons, find better weapons, fight the hordes of enemies and save your loved one from the deep. Be quick! Time for each turn is limited to 2 seconds!

## Try it out!

## A bit more about the project
I've created all the art and code myself. At the time I was pretty proud of myself. The game works, but it is not polished nor fully finished. The number of items is limited, there are not many enemies and they are not very smart. Please note that I've learned everything myself and I did not know much about programming (and so did my teachers lol).
